# ðŸ©º Doctor Appointment Multi-Agent System

This project is a multi-agent system for managing doctor appointments, built using FastAPI for the backend, LangGraph for agent orchestration (supervisor pattern), and Streamlit for a user-friendly frontend. The system can answer queries about doctor availability, book, cancel, or reschedule appointments, and handle FAQs related to hospital services.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent System:** Uses LangGraph to coordinate specialized agents (information, booking) under a supervisor pattern.
- **Doctor Appointment Management:** Check availability, book, cancel, or reschedule appointments.
- **Natural Language Queries:** Users can interact using natural language.
- **FastAPI Backend:** Provides a robust API for agent interaction.
- **Streamlit Frontend:** Simple, interactive web UI for end users.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- All Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd MediSched
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   conda create -p venv python=3.10 -y
   conda activate ./venv
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8003
```

### 2. Start the Streamlit Frontend

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```

- The Streamlit app will open in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).
- Ensure the FastAPI backend is running on port 8003 (or update `API_URL` in `streamlit_ui.py` if you change the port).

---

## Usage

- Enter your user ID and query (e.g., "Can you check if a dentist is available tomorrow at 10 AM?") in the Streamlit UI.
- The system will process your request using the multi-agent backend and display the response.

---

## Notes

- The backend uses a supervisor pattern to route queries to specialized agents (information or booking).
- Data files (e.g., doctor availability) are located in the `data/` directory.
- Example usage and data exploration can be found in the `notebook/` directory.
- For development or extension, see `agent.py` for agent logic and `toolkit/toolkits.py` for available tools.
